First, you must sort the cards by number, the jack, queen, and king cards corresponding to the numbers 11, 12, and 13 respectively in the deck.  This is the most efficient way as each deck of cards has 4 of each number, excluding the jokers, where there are only 2 in a deck, but still helps the purpose of organizing the deck.  Each set (i.e., all of the “1” cards, all of the “2” cards, all of the “king” cards, etc.) will be organized with the other sets in ascending order.  The “1” cards will start the deck, followed by the “2” cards, all the way to the 2 joker cards ending the deck.  Within each set, the cards will be organized by the different types of symbols in the cards.  Each set will have the heart card first, then the diamond card, then clubs, then spades.  This organization keeps the different colored cards together for the sake of organization.  This organization of the deck allows the user to be able to locate each specific card in the deck very easily.  The number of the cards can be found easily by following the chronological order of the deck since it is organized in ascending order of the numbers, and then the specific symbol of that card can be found easily as well as the color of the cards are kept together and then finding the specific symbol is between those two remaining cards.
